blueprint:
  name: Notification for Open Window and Low Temperature
  description: |
    This blueprint triggers a notification when:
    - The indoor temperature falls below a specified threshold.
    - At least one window is open (among multiple selected window sensors).
    - The outdoor temperature is lower than the indoor temperature.
    Use this to stay informed and avoid unnecessary energy loss.
